# Variables

    Update-Help

Same, but in English (gives you a complete help):

    Update-Help -UICulture en-US

Save the help to `DIRECTORY` (a.k.a. take a huge XML dump):

    Save-Help -DestinationPath DIRECTORY -UICulture en-US

    Get-Help TOPIC

Show help (paged):

    Help TOPIC

    Help -Full TOPIC

Show help online (i.e. in a browser):

    Help -Online TOPIC

Show example section of help:

    Help -Example TOPIC

List all commands:

    Get-Command

List all commands for a noun/verb:

    Get-Command -Noun NOUN
    Get-Command -Verb VERB

# Running Commands

There are different kinds of commands:

- Cmdlet ("command-let"): PowerShell command-line utilities written in a .Net-Language (e.g. C#)
- Function: piece of code written in PowerShell
- Application: executable written in any language

Scripts have the `.ps1` extension.

Command names are all case _insensitive_ and follow the convention `[Verb]-[Noun]`. (See `Get-Verb` for conventionally used "verbs".)

The invocation operator `&` can run a command with a name stored in a variable:

    $cmd = 'ping'
    & $cmd google.com

The operator `%-- [...]` prevents parsing of `[...]`.

## Execution Policy

Policies (set machine-wide) protect the user from _accidentally_ running harmful scripts:

- `Restricted` (default on Windows 10): no script execution allowed
- `RemoteSigned` (default on Windows Server): all local script and signed remote script execution allowed
- `AllSigned` (stricter): signed script execution allowed
- `Unrestricted`: all script execution allowed
- `Bypass`: for embedded PowerShell use

Commands:

- `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
- `Set-ExecutionPolicy` (only as Admin)

The PowerShell can be started with the `-ExecutionPolicy POLICY` option.

The Execution Policy can also be configured by a Group Policy Object (GPO).

## Aliases

Aliases only emcompass the command, but no parameters. (There are parameter aliases, too: see `Get-Help about_CommonParameters`.)

- `New-Alias`: create a new temporary alias (for the current session)
- `Export-Alias`: export aliases
- `Import-Alias`: import aliases

## Positional Parameters

Any parameter with its name surrounded in `[]` in the help text is a positional parameter:

    Get-Foo [[-Param] ...]

# Miscellaneous

- Powershell 5.1 is called "Windows PowerShell" and has the binary `powershell.exe` and a blue background by default.
- Powershell 7.x is called "PowerShell" and has the binary `pwsh.exe` and a black background by default.
- ISE: Integrated Scripting Environment (host application), outdated; use Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension instead
